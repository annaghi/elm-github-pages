# Elm GitHub Pages

A port of [rafrex/spa-github-pages](https://github.com/rafrex/spa-github-pages) for Elm.

Deploy Elm web apps with GitHub Project Pages.
The source files are published from the `docs` folder located on the `master` branch.

#### Demo

Follow [annaghi.github.io/elm-github-pages](https://annaghi.github.io/elm-github-pages) and make some page reloads on the internal links.

#### Development

```bash
npm run watch
```

#### Build

```bash
npm run build
```

#### Caveat

You need to maintain two versions of the `index.html` file - one for local development and one for GitHub.
